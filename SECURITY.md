# Security & Privacy

## No Personal Data Collection

This tool runs **100% locally** on your machine. It does not:
- ❌ Send any data to external servers
- ❌ Collect personal information
- ❌ Access files outside of what you explicitly provide
- ❌ Store credentials or API keys
- ❌ Track usage or analytics

## File Access

The tool only accesses:
- ✅ Video files you explicitly select
- ✅ Output directories you specify
- ✅ Configuration files in the project directory

## Safe Defaults

- All output goes to user-specified directories (default: `~/Desktop/clips`)
- No hardcoded personal paths in the codebase
- All paths use environment variables or relative paths
- `.gitignore` excludes all personal content

## Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.
